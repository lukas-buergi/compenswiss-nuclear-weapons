This project takes data from compenswiss, which invests money on behalf of AHV / AVS and tries to find out which of the invested money goes towards nuclear weapons.

Data source: https://www.compenswiss.ch/de/vermoegensanlage/anlageklassen, "Verm√∂genspositionen" towards the bottom of the page.

This doesn't find all such investments, most likely (because of indirect investments and the like). So all figures are minimums.
